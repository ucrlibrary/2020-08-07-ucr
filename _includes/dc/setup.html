<h3>Data Organization in Spreadsheets</h3>

To interact with spreadsheets, we can use LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel,
Gnumeric, or other programs. Commands may differ a bit between programs, but
the general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.

For this lesson, if you don't have a spreadsheet program already, you can use
LibreOffice. It's a free, open source spreadsheet program.

macOS users who use Apple's Numbers application should note that it does not
contain some of the features (particularly data validation) that we will
be using. Please use LibreOffice or Microsoft Excel instead.
